As the machine learning and dashboard have been trained, developed and evaluated, they are then deployed. The environment for deployment at the end user of the products has to be prepared. It was agreed with the client that a dashboard developed with PowerBI, a model and web logs be presented as the final products. This section then acts as step-by-step instructions on how a working prototype is transferred from the developerâ€™s environment to the one of the client.

## PRODUCTS TO BE DELIVERED 

Web log files
Web log files in a CSV file format will be one of the products to be delivered to the client. The log files were generated by a software tool which generates dummy data and can be accessed at https://www.mockaroo.com/. All the desired data attributes which resonate with real world logs access of a sports website were used. The log files were then transformed into CSV file format and read with Microsoft Excel. Microsoft requires a license for their products including Excel. The license used was Office 365. 
Model
A clustering model is also the end product that will be delivered at the end of the project. The model will use python programming language and will be build in a Jupyter.  
## DASHBOARD 

The last expected product to be delivered is a dashboard and PowerBI will be used to build the dashboard. It will be interactive and meet the functional requirements agreed with the client. The client suggested using PowerBI in developing the dashboard. 

## INSTALLATION OF RESOUCRES 

The latest version of python 3.11.3 was downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads/. The IDE used for this project was Jupyter Notebook, it runs on the web but still needs to be downloaded. Anaconda has to be downloaded which has a package for Jupyter and can be downloaded at https://www.anaconda.com/download. Once the download is complete, installation of both the resources is easy as the steps not complicated and there is a documentation on installation. 
PowerBI can be installed into the host machine by downloading the PowerBI desktop and there is also an online version of the platform. PowerBI desktop can be downloaded at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494. PowerBI has a free version but there is a paid subscription which includes two subscriptions being pro and premium. The pricing of the two subscriptions depends on their application. PowerBI desktop was used for the project and a free trial was used.
